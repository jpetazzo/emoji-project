# The Emoji Project
## The Project Formerly Known as Slack Icons

Project initially started by gathering icons / emoji for Slack, but can easily be used with Discord and other services as well.

I'll admit that I don't normally check for PRs / Issues because this isn't something that's historically been used by anyone else but me as far as I know. So if you do have an PR / Issue that you've submitted and we happen to be in a shared Slack (or Discord) I'd recommend DMing me there. ðŸ˜…

## Rules

The majority of the Icons / Emoji in here are a combination of images that I've made into the appropriate size (max 128 px width, height, or both if square) or ones that I've found in communities or workplaces I've been in. If you have a ones that you'd like to submit, please feel free! That said:

* No faces, unless they're "meme'd" faces (e.g. Picard for Facepalm). This is to prevent any company/community specific people from ending up in a public repo without me having to do a mental exercise of "who is _technically_ a public figure and according to whom". 
* Simiarly, if there're images that you know are restricted to your org for any reason, even if they aren't faces, don't submit them. Things that don't "look private" I may not catch, so I'd rely on the submitters integrity there.
* Try to follow the directory pattern when submitting. Once an icon "family" has more than a few members they usually get a dedicated folder. For example, one mario-dancing icon is just in the parent folder, however if you're submitting a set of them move the existing into a Mario (or whatever) folder and then add yours for the PR.
* When an icon type is specific and has a "family" pattern, then the icon names need to be shifted to that pattern. Easy example is the "party parrot" series (common in Slacks / Discords, so not separately uploaded here). The folder would be "Party Parrot" and the icons would all be named the pattern "party-parrot-xxxx" where xxxx is "conga" or whatever.
* Respect dash vs underscore convensions. Here, for consistency, they're all dashes but when you upload to your org please use whatever is dominant there when naming the icons.
* If you have emoji you wanna submit but aren't sure where to put them, feel free to submit, mention in the PR, and I'll reconcile.
* Note I keep backlogging a way to batch load the emoji into a Slack, mainly because this project gets the most attention when I join an org and start adding them, so. Anyway if anyone wants to PR or submit thoughts for that feel free.
